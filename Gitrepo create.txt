Create GitHub Repository
-------------------------------

Go to github.com. If you already have the GitHub account, then login using that
account or create a new one. Follow the steps from github.com website to create
a new repository.
Push Operation
Tom decides to use the GitHub server. To start a new project, he creates a new
directory and one file inside that.
[tom@CentOS]$ mkdir github_repo
[tom@CentOS]$ cd github_repo/
[tom@CentOS]$ vi hello.c
[tom@CentOS]$ make hello
cc hello.c -o hello
[tom@CentOS]$ ./hello
The above command will produce the following result:
Hello, World !!!
After verifying his code, he initializes the directory with the git init command and
commits his changes locally.
[tom@CentOS]$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/tom/github_repo/.git/
[tom@CentOS]$ git status -s
?? hello
?? hello.c
[tom@CentOS]$ git add hello.c
[tom@CentOS]$ git status -s
A hello.c
?? hello
[tom@CentOS]$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'

After that, he adds the GitHub repository URL as a remote origin and pushes his
changes to the remote repository.

[tom@CentOS]$ git remote add origin
https://github.com/kangralkar/testing_repo.git
[tom@CentOS]$ git push -u origin master


Username for 'https://github.com': kangralkar
Password for 'https://kangralkar@github.com':

To https://github.com/kangralkar/test_repo.git
* [new branch] master âˆ’> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.

From now, Tom can push any changes to the GitHub repository. He can use all
the commands discussed in this chapter with the GitHub repository.

PULL REquest
--------------------------
Tom successfully pushed all his changes to the GitHub repository. Now, other
developers can view these changes by performing clone operation or updating
their local repository.
Jerry creates a new directory in his home directory and clones the GitHub
repository by using the git clone command.


[jerry@CentOS]$ pwd
/home/jerry
[jerry@CentOS]$ mkdir jerry_repo
[jerry@CentOS]$ git clone https://github.com/kangralkar/test_repo.git

The above command produces the following result:

Cloning into 'test_repo'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
He verifies the directory contents by executing the ls command.

[jerry@CentOS]$ ls
test_repo
[jerry@CentOS]$ ls test_repo/
hello.c
