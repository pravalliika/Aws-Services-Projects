Imagine you're building a city in the cloud! You need roads, buildings, and even a way to connect to the internet. In the cloud world, we call this creating a "VPC" (Virtual Private Cloud)**, and we’ll walk you through it step by step.

Step 1: Create Your City (VPC)

First, you need to make your city, which is called a "VPC". Think of it as a fenced area where you will build everything. 

1. Go to the AWS VPC service.
2. Click on "Create VPC".
3. Name your city (VPC) and give it a block of space (CIDR range, which tells how big your city is).
Once done, hit "Create" – boom! Your city is now built.

Step 2: Build Zones (Subnets)

In your city, you will create different areas (subnets) where different things will happen, like app servers, web servers, and database servers.

1. Click to create a "subnet".
2. Choose the VPC you just created.
3. Name your first zone, for example, "App Server."
4. Pick a spot (availability zone) and give it a small block of space (a CIDR range, like a house number inside the city).

Repeat these steps for two more zones, like "Web Server" and "Database Server". Make sure each zone is in a different spot (availability zone) and has its own space!


Step 3: Connect to the Internet (Internet Gateway)

Now, we need a way for people to visit your city from outside. This is where the "Internet Gateway (IGW)" comes in. It's like the big gate letting people in and out.

1. Click on "Create Internet Gateway".
2. Give it a name and create it.
3. Attach this gateway to your VPC to connect your city to the internet!

Step 4: Add Roads (Route Table)

Your city now needs roads to direct traffic! The **Route Table** tells data where to go.

1. Create a "Route Table".
2. Add a new rule that connects the Internet Gateway to your city, so traffic from the internet can get in.
3. Finally, attach your subnets to this Route Table so they can use the roads!

You've now built a VPC, created zones (subnets), connected it to the internet (Internet Gateway), and set up roads (Route Table) to guide the traffic. Your cloud city is ready!
